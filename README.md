1. With the information below create a dictionary of the below and find out what action would be the cheapest by using linear algebra for each person.

**Needs to buy dogs for their pet shop**  

|person|dog_labrador|dog_puddle|dog_rottweiler|dog_bulldog|traveling_expense|
|--|--|--|--|--|--|
|p1|6|5|3|1|1|
|p2|3|6|2|2|1|
|p3|3|4|3|1|1|
|p4|15|4|3|8|0|

**Prices in the different countries**  

|Countries|Denmark|UK|China|USA|
|--|--|--|--|--|
|dog_labrador|2500|1700|700|1699|
|dog_puddle|4500|3000|2000|1500|
|dog_rottweiler|500|450|4500|890|
|dog_bulldog|1600|1700|1200|1900|
|traveling_expense|2600|2700|9000|5000|

2. All of the owners suddenly found out that they need to buy 3 times as many rottweilers and 10 times as many for bulldogs than previous expected.
	1. Multiply so that there are 3 times as many rottweilers and 10 times as many bulldogs
	2. Again let's see what course of action is best for each person and how much it would cost now.
	3. How much will each of the persons have saved by not used the most expensive action?

3. Download below data
	1. GDP (current US$) - European Union: http://api.worldbank.org/v2/en/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD?downloadformat=csv
	2. EU prices for selected representative products: https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/market-prices-fruit-products_en_6.csv

4. From 3.1. Find the GDP from 1995-2020 for:
	1. Greece
	2. Spain
	3. France
	4. Italy
	5. Portugal
	6. EU

5. From 3.2. Find the price of below items from 1995-2020 (2020-06) for the countries in assignment 4.
	1. Strawberries
	2. Nectarines
	3. Apples Braeburn

6. With this data.
	1. Make a line plot of 4. and 5.
	2. Try to create a correlation between the GDP and the price of the 3 products.

7. Using sklearn
	1. Predict the price of strawberries and the GDP in year 3020.

Extra:
8. With all of the data from exercise 4 and 5.
	1. Find out if there is a linear relationship between features and show the correlation.
